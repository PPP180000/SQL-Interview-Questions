Exercises in Data Extraction and Presentation

All requested tasks described here are based on the “Sakila” database which may be download from the official MySQL website.  It is assumed that if you are working through the problems below, you have already taken the time to install MySQL Server on your PC and then familiarized yourself with that database.

The questions to follow will have a mix of expectations that include code *and* sometimes explanations for why the provided sample code provided in this test is generating undesirable results.  To put it another way, the questions are meant to assess coding ability and knowledge of basic techniques.  In addition, one or more of the outputs shown for the questions below *may be intentionally wrong*.  It is expected that your skill will identify such scenarios.   You may take any technical approach you deem necessary to solve the problem, including creation of temporary tables unless otherwise stated.

In addition, most of the outputs you will see here will be for aliased fields.  You should not expect to find the column, but instead be able to properly infer what data sources have been utilized.
